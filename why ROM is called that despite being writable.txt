PROM is very much 'read only'. This is because E/EPROM requires:

erasure by UV (EPROM) or an 0xFF cycle (EEPROM),
switching into a different mode for programming ('writing') data,
which in some cases requires different power conditions, wait times, etc.
Limitations on write cycles would make all extant PROMs useless for the kind of high-volume data transfer/manipulation needed by many programs.
...all of which mean that the act of writing to such memory is slow, can't be efficiently interleaved with read operations, actively wears out the chip, etc.

PROM is on a totally different league than RAM with equivalent read specs. Hence why it wasn't marketed as any form of RAM. The backlash would've been colossal!

So, we could perhaps call it Read Mostly Memory or, for the pedants, EWRPROM: Eventually Writable, 
Runtime Practically Read Only Memory... but in practical terms, ROM is bang on the mark

Electrically erasable programmable ROM (EEPROM)â€”Can be erased by an electrical charge, then written to by using higher-than-normal voltage
